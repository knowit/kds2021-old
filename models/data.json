In this short talk, well introduce our groups ambitions and initiatives, with a special focus on the creation of the interdisciplinary Frontiers forum and a living front-end guidelines template you can start using today. Well tell you why we wrote the guidelines, how we found them useful them in a recent project, what we believe to be their current shortcomings, and how you can get involved and help us improve them, to everyones benefit. Our goal is to develop a useful, internal tool that will help you spend less time solving the same, old problems and more time blazing trails and addressing the unique and exciting challenges posed by your particular project.

And so it began.\n\nNot knowing exactly what we had bargained for. We found ourselves battling concurrency more each passing day. Trying to make sense of how to juggle BrowserWindows, dependencies on detached servers, V8's garbage collection, and where and when to utilise this new wonderful thing called async-await  except. The promise wasn't always kept.\n\nI needed a new weapon to win this war. I begun crafting, what I call, an Electron Bootstrap Sequence.

How do you test your database constraints, your database access code, your API endpoints, and the interoperability between your different independently deployed services?\n\nThis talk presents a compilation of different methods you can use to write tests for every aspect of your application:\n* dependencies to your application,\n* all the layers within your application, and\n* your application's dependencies to other services (with a special focus on databases).\nIt will be structured somewhat like a cookbook, with concrete examples provided.\n\nThis talk will be useful to anyone who would like to learn more about the non-trivial parts of writing automated tests for backend services. It represents half a decade's worth of hard-earned knowledge from real test use cases. The talk may be particularly enlightening to junior developers, but more experienced developers will likely also stand to learn a thing or two. The examples will be in Java, but the approaches should be applicable in other backend languages as well. ",

This narrowing of focus can implicitly idealize our view of peoples needs and circumstance, in ways that are not always helpful.\n\nWe take pride in relieving pain points - but dont as easily envision the pain our products might introduce or amplify in peoples lives. There are some edge cases that cannot be ignored, because the consequences are too great. And there are some things that simply arent as far to the edge as wed like to imagine.\n\nWe can roll back the code, or iterate the product  but we cannot roll back the consequences we cause in peoples lives along the way. By combining a risk based approach with compassion, we can learn how to make products and experiments that are safe to fail in the environment of real life.",

A successful concept that inspired SwiftUI and JetpackCompose.\nIn this talk, we will go through a quick brief introduction of Flutter and what makes it a powerful multi-platform framework.

You either had to add bulky image files for each screen size or write a thousand lines of brittle, hard-to-maintain code. Because of this, most apps werent using animation  despite it being a powerful tool for communicating ideas and creating compelling user experiences.\n\nLottie uses animation data exported as JSON files from an open-source After Effects extension called Bodymovin. The extension is bundled with a JavaScript player that can render the animations realtime on the web.\n\nLottie allows engineers to build richer animations without the painstaking overhead of re-writing them.\n\nJoin this talk and learn how you can utilize Lottie for your projects.\n",
